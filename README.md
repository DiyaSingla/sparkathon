# Sustainix - Empowering sustainable choices

Sustainix is an innovative and impactful recommendation system designed to contribute to the United Nations' sustainability goals. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, Sustainix empowers users to make environmentally conscious choices in their shopping habits. The system analyzes and provides recommendations based on the carbon footprint values of products, ensuring that users can opt for more eco-friendly alternatives without compromising their preferences, specifications, and budget.

## Key features

### Carbon Footprint-Based Recommendations:

Sustainix revolves around the concept of carbon footprint awareness. When users explore products on the platform, they receive personalized recommendations that align with their commitment to reducing carbon emissions. For instance, if a user clicks on a product with a carbon footprint value of 200, Sustainix intelligently generates suggestions for products with lower carbon footprints, while maintaining similar specifications and prices.
The API for generating the recommendations for a product can be accessed from [here](http://sustainable-recommender.vercel.app/recommendations/0). Note that the endpoint for this API is /recommendations/product_index where product_index is an integer value ranging from 0 to 1448.

### Curated Dataset:

Every recommendation is powered by a meticulously compiled dataset crafted by our dedicated team. This dataset is the result of in-depth research and compilation of product carbon footprint reports from renowned laptop brands including Dell, Acer, Asus, Lenovo, and HP. This ensures that the recommendations provided are not only accurate but also relevant to real-world products. This dataset has been deployed [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw08tF8pg8Qi4-uwyqeZKefbTb2OWAKhVydTCBSLgqhJ5y59gpTBvcIX-LwKpX7RfTRRg/exec).
